This repository contains a Dockerfile that fails to build due to a missing file.  The error message is not very descriptive, making it hard to debug. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle file locations and dependencies within the Docker build process.  This is a common issue when developers forget to copy the application into the image before attempting to execute it. The solution provides best practices for creating robust and easy-to-debug Dockerfiles.
